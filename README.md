# To set up projects like this one do the following :


1. Install ruby (I used 1.8)
1. gem install compass
1. install node
1. npm -g install yo (this installs grunt and bower as well).
1. npm -g install generator-express-angular
1. Create an empty project in github
1. cd to that project
1. run "yo express-angular"


# tweaks made to the "express-angular" template

1. I modified some "src" tags from "component/..." to "bower_component/..." - seems like a minor bug.


# Working with this project


1. grunt server - runs the server with "watch" capabilities (it reloads when you change the scss files).
1. IDEs should ignore the following folders
1.1. dist
1.1. .tmp
1.1. .sass-cache
1.1. node_modules
